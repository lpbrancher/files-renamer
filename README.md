# files-renamer
Routinely I receive bad named files to use and if I donÂ´t rename them, the server becomes mad and start throwing things at me (mostly errors). Why install a power-renamer tool if I can do it with code? ðŸ¥·

### How to use
Just put the files to be renamed in the rename_this folder, regexp variable in the code and run it with node. If filtering is needed (why though), uncomment and change the filter variable.
